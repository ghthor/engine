## [inactive] [1] BUG Narrow phase collision solving order
### Recursive descent narrow phase collision solver
I need to build a map of collisions indexed by each entity.
With this data I can apply this algorithm.

```
A is moving into B.
Does B have any unique collisions it must Solve? Yes
Are we here because of this unsolved collision? No

B is moving into C.
Does C have any unique collisions is must Solve? Yes
Are we here because of this unsolved collision? No

C is moving into D.
Does D have any unique collisions it must Solve? Yes
Are we here because of this unsolved collision? No

D is moving into A.
Does A have any unique collisions it must Solve? Yes
Are we here because of this unsolved collision? Yes
Then we must solve `D is moving into A` with the information we have.
    - We could make blanket assumption that D cannot move.
        This means that D will lose a movement race from E.
        At first glance, I think this would be fine.
```

... Wait
If D can't move than none of the entities can move.
At second glance this is the correct behavior...

This makes recursive descent exactly what I want.
