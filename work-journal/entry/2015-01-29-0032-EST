# journal - Productive day | Getting closer to playable
Got a decent amount done today.
Implemented Join for Bounds.
Mostly implemented the broad phase,
have a few things to finish up concerning it tomorrow.

Was happy with closures to alias, 
coord.Cell and coord.Bounds to c() and b().
Improved the test code's brevity to a certain degree.

Casey didn't like the term Chunk.
He suggested collision group, and hes right.
While working on the code that generates the chunks
I ran into some fuzzy details.
Currently the chunk generation isn't checking for
existence in the chunk.Entities array when it add's
an entity. This is a bad mistake that I'll need to fix.

My plan currently is to implement collision group
and make array of Collisions instead of entities.
This will be more useful to the narrow phase anyway.
If I don't make these here that the narrow phase will
be making them, which isn't all that bad. But in the
long run I think it would be a section of code that
should be inside engine.

I'm going to cut this entry here,
I fucked up and somehow closed the terminal tab
I was writing it in and lost the execution of journal.

I have to manually commit this enty, no big deal,
just can't edit any ideas
