# journal - Work around for deficiencies in my quad tree
To avoid dealing with the issues related to uneven heights or widths
I just don't let the user do it. If the H and W are even then the
quad will always split into sections. As I type this I don't know
If this actually true. Maybe I should test this. I should test this.

Haha.
Well I think I'll just leave an idea here for it. I really want
to move forward with the implementing the phases. I'd like to
have everything working as it was before, soon, like in a day
or 2.
