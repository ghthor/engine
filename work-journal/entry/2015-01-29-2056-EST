# journal - Broad phase is almost complete
Really glad that I sat down with Maia today and explained some of the engine.
Was a really great help having to explain the problem to get me oriented in
the write direction. I need to add some more test cases to hit some more of
the case statements in the quad node broad phase implementation.

There are also a few cases in the quad leaf implementation that are not
hit as well. Once I hit those I can say the broad phase is complete.

When the broad phase is complete I can move into the user space implementation
of the input and movement phase and the narrow phase. The next few days should
be very exciting.
