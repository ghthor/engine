# Welcome Back - Loose Plans
So it's been a year since I've last checked in here.
Work has been moving forward with stream processing experimentation.
Authentication and Actor selection has a streaming implementation.
I have plans to make pass over Auth and unify the API interface to a
consistent pattern, modeled off of the version used in Actor.

A few weeks back I was working on porting the networking portion
from aodd into filu. It has very little to do with the mechanics
of aodd and making filu it's home makes perfect sense. I believe
the next step in the process is porting the ActorConnection step
in the protocol. Once that is completed aodd will require updating
it's networking bits to use the filu packages.
