# journal - Some thoughts on AI
Riding the train into Hacker School this morning I was thinking about AI.
How does attention happen in the brain?
Maybe it's partially biological?

Like lets say I have this new brain, it's dumb.
Every pattern it sees is a new pattern.
But it has biological impulses that help it focus.
Like food smelling good to eat.
