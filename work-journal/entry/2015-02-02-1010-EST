# journal - Finishing out the broad phase today
If everything actually goes to planned today, I should be moving on to user code.
I need to hit a few other cases for the broad phase.

Something I'm not very happy with is how the tests are currently laid out.
I'm thinking that I will re-factor the tests out into separate descriptions.
All I know is the current way isn't great and I don't like it.
