# journal - Big Picture architecture stuff
Been thinking about where I want this to be heading during this rewrite.
I need to have a database in here somewhere, I can't ignore that.
So what I'm thinking is starting db design phase sometime soon.

The overall architecture of the server is going to stay the same, but the impl
is going to be changing.
The current version is too prone to breaking and doesn't make much sense to me.
The simulation loop and the input processing/output loops are the main issue right now.
They are the parts that are depending on all this messy implementation code.

I need to look what needs to be brought out of the client now.
The protocol stuff and conn stuff I know for sure can be.

I'm going to design the database with the engine having one connection.
And then all the http/udp clients can have there own connections.
I will have a full db build file in the repo along with migrations.
Once I hit a stable point the migrations will be deleted and
they will be restarted. This is so there isn't a ton of cruft
that builds up over time because of them.
