#~ LOG - What I remember last
I know there was an outstanding collision bug.
It had something to do with moving into an occupied cell where both entities were moving in the same position.
This may have been fixed though.
Only way is to actually test it, and read through the collision specifications.

I know I have some pictures of my whiteboarding for the "realtime" collision system.
They should be found and placed into this repository.

Other then that, I know that my immediate focus was trying to use perlin noise to generate a terrain map.
This task seemed important at the time and was really interesting.
But, I was having issues understanding how the perlin 2d algorithm was seeded with static.
I was basing my port on a python implementation I found online.
Unfortunately I believe the source for generating 2d static as slices of slices was lost.
This isn't that important because it is straight forward to implement.
