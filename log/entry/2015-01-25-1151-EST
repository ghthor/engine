# journal - Some things to clean up quad
I have those stupid height/width != 1 check that panic.
My hack work around doesn't even make sense....
Well it does, it needs to NOT divide if it's that size.
But the other thing, Is I just don't understand what's going
on there. I need to attack this problem when I'm more
well rested. I'm running on empty now. I got the
algorithm for bubbling the out of bounds entities during
the recursive decent of the input application phase.

As far as I could tell, it was working as expected.
We'll have to see when I'm not on empty.
