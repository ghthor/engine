# journal - Architecture diagram and interface design
I am extremely happy with the progress I've made today.
Allowing myself to accept that I needed to step back and
do a "rewrite" has freed my mind to apply a functional
design using interfaces.

Immediately after I committed the Simulation and Actor
interfaces I knew exactly what I needed to do.
Create a pkg and implement them.
The rpg2d implementation will be the first style,
but the system itself and the behavior is applicable
to any number of implementations. 3d, 2d, maybe even
non-realtime. I'm also fairly positive the generic
nature of the StateConn interface will allow me to make clients
of all varieties, Browser and Native(OpenGL), and AI
endpoints in any language that can use a UDP socket.

I may have enough time today to port the existing quadtree
implementation as the in memory storage for rpg2d.
I'm going to go take a break for now and maybe do a
little socialization, take a walk.
