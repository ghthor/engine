# journal - Rifts
So I'm sitting thinking about this seamless problem.
If the actor is connected to both servers at a seam chunk.
And both servers are calculating the chunks next state.
Theres still this seam at the chunks edge where, one server
becomes authoritative if the actor moves over it. This
will cause problems. How does ability damage travel
over this seam? How does collision detection work over
the seam? Look at how I'm doing the unsolvables just
between chunks in the same quad tree. Does the root node
of the quadtree have to communicate with the other server
to verify locations of actors?

The other issue is dos'ing 2 servers by having lots of actors
active in the seam chunks. One thing that could happen is
if there are many many actors in the chunks bordering the
seams than it just becomes a hard zone wall with a load
time. The seam could also encourage a low population of
actors around it by becomes more dangerous to be around.
Spawning more monsters, higher chance of death, etc.

Maybe this encouragement would be enough to avoid large
crowds around the seams. 

I want the user experience to be smooth and appear
completely seamless. But if there is a performance issue
at some value of N active actors in the chunk seam and
I can't solve it technically, maybe I can solve it with
mythos. A otherly world rift is opened and produces some
very dangerous conditions. Also causes a hard zoning wall
with a load time. If it appears to be a zone wall
and it acts like a zone wall, than users shouldn't
realize it wasn't a zone wall.
